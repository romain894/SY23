This repository contains a basic library developped for array manipulations on microcontrollers and embedded systems. It is written in C and C++ with basic functions such as addition, substraction, multiplication, LU decomposition and matrix inversion. It is available as a dynamic library for Pis or a static library for arduinos.

--------------------------------------------------------

The sensors applications are written in Arduino C++ and contains basic memory register manipulation. I2C communication with the PmodHygro sensor gets the temperature and humidity both in one read. Both information are written with 2 bytes and displayed through serial interface.
